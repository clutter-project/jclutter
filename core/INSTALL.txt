
INSTALL
=======

Make sure that you have all dependencies installed:
- Java JDK 1.5+
- Ant (for building and running tests)
- Clutter 1.2+ and its dependencies (glib, cairo, pango).

These are commands to install dependencies on Ubuntu/Debian :

sudo apt-get openjdk-6-jre ant
sudo apt-get libx11-dev libxext-dev libxfixes-dev libxdamage-dev libxcomposite-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
sudo apt-get libpango1.0-dev libcairo2-dev  libglib2.0-dev libgdk-pixbuf-dev libgtk2.0-dev


BUILD
=====

Building all (java + native + tests) is done by running "ant all".
Building the jclutter jar alone is done by running "ant".

Note : this has only been tested on Ubuntu.
Check the ant.properties file for details on the variables used during compilation.


TEST
====

To run a test type "ant test-xxx", where test-xxx is the test name.
Run "ant -p" to list all targets available.
For example, this can be run :

ant test-interactive-actors

Note : if the clutter native library is not found you may need to execute :
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/ (or appropriate path)
