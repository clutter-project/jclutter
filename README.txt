JClutter
========

JClutter implements the Java binding for APIs provided by the Clutter Toolkit project.

The project is divided into three main parts:

- "core" is where clutter main API is bound.
- "ext" is for third party actor implementations such as webkit and gstreamer actors.
- "integration" is for subprojects looking to integrate jclutter with existing (java) UI frameworks.
