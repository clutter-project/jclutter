JClutter AWT Integration
========================

!!The implementation has not started yet!!

The primary focus is to use the AWT Native interface to create a JClutterCanvas implementation.
Having this type of component would be useful for displaying stages 
in an applet or standalone java applications for preview and tooling purposes.

AWT component peers may be implemented in the future.
